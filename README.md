# Hal's Personal Portfolio Site (under construction)
If you'd like, you can preview this site by cloning it locally. Once cloned...

1. Execute `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Execute `npm run dev` to spin up development server
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the site

Feedback and comments are very welcome as I am learning NextJS and Tailwind :)
