    "We met while working together at a dog daycare! Hal was the first person Olivia saw after walking into the building (though it was more like stumbling in after misunderstanding the entry gate mechanism) for her interview. Both of us later shared that we felt something special in that moment.",
    "We quickly found that we had a shared love for music, dogs, and long, rambling emails which led to an inevitable friendship. Lots of playlists were made.",
    "On a blustery day, we hung out and took Beans to Whidbey Island and found a dog-friendly beach called Double Bluff. We hit every stroke of luck that day: making the ferry with no wait, discovering the beach, Beans finding a gorgeous piece of driftwood (which later became art that now hangs in our home), and wrapping up the day with a giant bowl of Ramen - we coined our classic ‚Äúbluffed it‚Äù phrase; used on days where things just go right and you feel entirely fulfilled.",
    "Olivia surprised Hal with a night enjoying Irish fare (H's favorite) and a Corinne Bailey Rae show (young H's favorite). Now recognized as our anniversary date!",
    "We traveled down to Oregon to see the 2017 Solar eclipse - seen here with our officiant, Nat, and witness, Will!",
    "River joins the family!",
    "A blur of weekend getaways, dog parks, new jobs, more friends.",
    "Hal's 30th birthday that we spent on Guemes Island - Olivia tracked down Hal's Nan's green bean casserole recipe and made pot roast & potatoes to pair.",
    "Moving in together (along with our roommate Will) - not knowing this would be our built-in social circle for the foreseeable future.",
    "A blur of (good) career changes, pet sitting, and -you guessed it- more dog parks.",
    "Our first international vacation in Sayulita, Mexico! Even if we spent 90% of it violently ill (and got to eat NO tacos ‚òπÔ∏è), we could have made a vacation out of a mud puddle and we fully enjoyed the days of rest that came along with it.",
    "We spent Olivia‚Äôs 30th birthday in Sequim, Washington - indulging in pure Taurean fashion: relaxing in a farmhouse deep in the woods, cooking, grilling, listening to music, taking baths, and driving around the countryside. On our last evening in the house, Hal proposed ü§†",
    "Olivia post-poses while on a camping trip (in which we ‚Äúbluffed it‚Äù and found the last open site on the last day of the season).",
    "We chose to elope quietly in a place where we (and the dogs) have spent a majority of our time: Discovery Park; greeting the morning together as we did on day one. "
